What is Java? Where it is used?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystem(now owned by Oracle group of companies) in 1995.It is designed to be simple, secure and platform-independent.
Java follows the principle "Write once, Use anywhere", which means that Java code can run on any device that has the Java Virutal Machine(JVM) installed in it.
It is widely used for developing:-
    -Web Application
    -Mobile Apps
    -Desktop Software
    -Enterprise Systems
    -Games and cloud-based Application

What is JVM,JRE and JDK? How they work together?
-Java Virtual Machine(JVM):- 
        -JVM is an engine that run Java bytecode.
        -It converts .class files(bytecode into machine code specific to the operating system).
        -Platform Independent:- You can run the same .class file on windows , Mac or Linux - because JVM handles the platform differences.
        -Kye Responsibilites of JVM:-
            -Verfies code
            -Execute code
            -Handles memory Management(Garbage Collection)

-Java Runtime Enviornment(JRE):-
    -Java is a software package that provides everything needed to run Java programs.
    -It Contains:-
        -JVM
        -Core Java class libraries
        -COnfiguration files

    -users who just want to run java programs not run them.

-Java Development Kit(JDK):-
    -JDK is a complete package for Java Developers.
    -It contains:-
        -JRE(so also contains JVM)
        -Java compliers
        -Java Tools
        -Development libraries

How they works together:-
You write code → .java file
↓
JDK compiles it → .class file (bytecode)
↓
JRE (with JVM) runs the .class file
↓
JVM converts bytecode → native machine code
↓
Program runs on your system
